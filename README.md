# ShanEnt

ShanEnt is a sequence analysis framework for the integrative analysis of amino acid sequence in a high-throughput manner. ShanEnt was developed in the context of working with intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions, but in principle could be used for any amino acid sequence.

ShanEnt is being developed by Garrett Ginell and Alex Holehouse at Washington University in St. Louis.
